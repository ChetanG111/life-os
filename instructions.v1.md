# DESIGN SYSTEM – DARK CONTROL PANEL

This app is a **personal operating system**, not a toy.  
Aesthetic: modern, sleek, surgical.

Vibe:
– dark mode only  
– serious  
– zero gimmicks  
– premium hardware feel  

Think:
Apple + Raycast + Linear  
Not neon SaaS trash.

# COLOR SYSTEM

Theme:
– Pure dark UI  
– Deep charcoal backgrounds  
– Soft gray surfaces  

Accent:
⚠️ **WHITE is the ONLY accent color.**
No blues.
No gradients.
No vibe-coded bullshit.

White is used for:
– primary actions  
– focused elements  
– highlights  
– selected states  

Everything else:
– grayscale only

# TYPOGRAPHY

Fonts:
– Inter / SF Pro / Geist  
– clean, modern  
– no handwritten nonsense  

Rules:
– hierarchy through size + weight  
– no decorative fonts  
– no playful rotations  

---

# SHAPE & RADIUS

– subtle rounding only  
– 10–16px radius  
– consistent everywhere  

No:
– wobbly borders  
– asymmetry  
– sketch effects  

This is a **machine**, not a doodle pad.

---

# SHADOWS & DEPTH

– soft, realistic elevation  
– layered depth  
– dark shadows  
– no cartoon hard edges  

Hover:
– slight lift  
– shadow increases  

Active:
– compress  
– shadow reduces  

---

# MOTION SYSTEM

Motion = premium physics.

Rules:
– non-linear easing only  
– spring-based  
– slight overshoot  
– slow settle  
– no wobble  
– no jelly  

Feels like:
iOS system animations.

No:
– goofy bounce  
– slime  
– playful wobble  

Detached elements:
– elastic drag  
– magnetic snap  
– smooth inertia  

Menus:
– staggered entrance  
– each item fades + slides  
– micro-delay between children  

---

# INTERACTIONS

Tap:
– subtle scale down  
– instant feedback  

Release:
– spring back  

Drag:
– resistance  
– momentum  

Scroll:
– rubber band edges  

---

# COMPONENT STYLE

Cards:
– flat  
– subtle depth  
– clean edges  

Buttons:
– minimal  
– white accent  
– no gradients  

Inputs:
– soft glow on focus  
– white underline  

---

# LAYOUT

– mobile-first  
– bottom navigation  
– no sidebars  
– single column focus  

Whitespace:
– generous  
– intentional  

---

# ICONS

– minimal  
– thin stroke  
– monochrome  
– white when active  

---

# FINAL RULE

This UI should feel like:
a hacker terminal  
a spacecraft dashboard  
a brain control center  

NOT:
a planner  
a journal  
a startup landing page  

If it looks playful, you failed.  
If it looks dangerous, you won.

END.
