design_philosophy: 
  name: "Liquid Fluidity"
  principles:
    - "Organic entry: Items should slide up with 30px offset and 0.9 scale."
    - "Non-linear stagger: Stagger delays must use weighted power curves for a more human feel."
    - "Contextual Glass: High-saturation translucency for fixed UI anchors."
    - "Physical Dismissal: Modals snap back with stiff springs (30 damping, 450 stiffness)."

  validation_criteria:
    - "Headers must blur content by 40px and remain fixed at top:0."
    - "Modal dismissal must feel 'physical' (high stiffness, no trailing bounce)."
    - "Stagger delays should feel 'accelerating' rather than a constant tick."
