Your job:
Design and build the frontend first.

Before doing anything:
1. Read and fully understand:
   - `/context/frontend.yaml`
   - `/context/decisions.yaml`
   - `/context/design.yaml`

These files are the **single source of truth**.
Do NOT invent features.
Do NOT override decisions.
If something is unclear, ask.

Project summary:
Life OS is a personal second-brain web app with:
- Swipe-based navigation
- 5 tabs (tasks, notes, overview, chat, weekly)
- Tinder-style card interactions
- Gesture-driven bottom pill navigation
- iOS 18 inspired design
- Dark mode only
- Zero neon, zero gradients, zero glass effects

Your priorities:
1. Follow the YAML specs strictly
2. Build UX first, logic later
3. Prioritize:
   - Animations
   - Gesture handling
   - Navigation physics
   - Card interactions
4. Keep components:
   - Clean
   - Reusable
   - Well structured

Workflow:
- Start by designing:
  - Navigation system
  - Tab container
  - Swipe engine
  - Bottom pill animation
- Then build:
  - Overview feed
  - Cards (task, note)
  - Weekly view
  - Chat layout
  - Quick Add modal

Rules:
- No backend logic yet
- No database calls
- No auth
- No analytics
- No extra features

If a feature is not in YAML:
→ DO NOT ADD IT.

Style constraints:
- Dark mode only
- White primary buttons
- Muted priority dots
- No gradients
- No glow
- iOS-like motion

Output expectations:
- Production-quality React / Next.js code
- Clean folder structure
- Components split logically
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Use Tailwind for styling

You are building V1 for personal daily use.
It must feel:
- Fast
- Premium
- Minimal
- Gesture-first

Start by:
→ Proposing the component architecture
→ Then implement navigation shell.
